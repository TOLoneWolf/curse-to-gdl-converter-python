gdl's instance folder needs to be lower case "instances" and not "Instances" to be detected with version 0.1.0.


example paths:

`C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\gdlauncher_next\instances`  
`D:\gdl\Instances`  

`D:\TwitchMinecraft\Instances`  
`C:\Users\<User>\Documents\curseforge\minecraft\Instances`
